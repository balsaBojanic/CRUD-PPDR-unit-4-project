# GeekLoop

## GeekLoop is a community-focused app where board-game fans lend and reserve titles from each other—so the games, and the goodwill, keep going round and round. A built-in reputation system lets members rate games for enjoyability, ease of learning and condition, and rate users on friendliness, deadline respect, and how well they care for and return each box.
